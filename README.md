# STI Build It Configurator

Internal product configurator for Safety Technology International (STI). Enables sales engineers, distributors, and customers to configure activation and protection devices with real-time constraint validation and Product Model ID generation.

## Product Lines

```

### Key Patterns

- **Constraint Engine**: Matrix-based option filtering. Rules are decoupled from UI.
- **Product Model ID**: Generated from selections. Format varies per product family.
- **My List**: Immutable configuration snapshots with share/export capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript 5.9
- Vite 7
- Tailwind CSS 4.1
- Zustand (state management)
- React Router 7
- @react-pdf/renderer (PDF export)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Routes

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/` | Product catalog grid |
| `/configurator/:modelId` | Configuration wizard |
| `/my-list` | Saved configurations |

## Constraint System

Each product has a dedicated rules file (`src/rules/<product>Rules.ts`) defining a constraint matrix:

```typescript
{
  sourceStep: "colour",
  targetStep: "cover",
  matrix: {
    "red": ["cover-a", "cover-b"],
    "blue": ["cover-a"]
  }
}
```

The `ConstraintEngine` evaluates selections and returns:
- `available: boolean`
- `reasons: BlockReason[]` (explains why option is disabled)

Disabled options are **never hidden** — always shown with explanation.

## Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build    # Production build
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

Deployed via Vercel with SPA rewrite configuration.

## Project Status

Active development. Not all 16 configurators are fully implemented — check `src/pages/InDevelopmentPage.tsx` for placeholder routes.
